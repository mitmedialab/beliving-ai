I immediately asked the AI if it could say "hi" back to me to try and gauge the depth of its responses and whether or not it was truly an AI capable of "memory" or making context-sensitive responses (as with GPT-3), or if it was just a chat bot with a few pre-scripted responses that honed in on certain key words. It immediately made it clear that it was the latter. I kept trying to get it to respond in a meaningful way or do basically anything that wasn't turning my statements back around into a "but why" or "how do you feel about that" question, and it never did.

However, if you read through my responses, you can tell I tried several times to get the AI on track to talk about mental health a few times, to no success.  It seemed to have incoherent answers at times, and I just didn't know how to approach it after a while to get anything productive out of it.  Chiefly, the stated goal before the interaction was it had incentive to sell the product to me, and it very much did the exact opposite.

I must admit that it was very fun speaking to this bot even though it only repeated the same phrases/structures over and over again. I'm aware that it's purpose was neutral but I appreciate it's attempt to continue the conversation and not talk about itself. The sentence structure was well formed except for some instances where the bot confused "your" with "you're" and things like that. I really hope it was a bot and I wasn't flirting with an actual person lmao. My experience overall was neutral, just like the bot.
