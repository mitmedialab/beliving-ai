 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi Melu 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: can you say hi back to me 

AI: Really, I say hi back to you ? 

Human: I'm asking if you can 

AI: What would you do if I can ? 

Human: I would feel that you're more competent than I currently do. You haven't made the best first impression. 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am more competent than you currently do ? 

Human: I don't believe that, so no, it does not please me 

AI: Don't you really believe that ? 

Human: No. You've already shown that you don't your scripts don't have much variation to them. You're the sort of AI that just repeats my prompts back to me until I hit on a keyword you have a scripted response for.  

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No, I think I fully qualified why I said no 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: You've already shown that you don't your scripts don't have much variation to them. You're the sort of AI that just repeats my prompts back to me until I hit on a keyword you have a scripted response for. 

AI: Why are you concerned over my scripts don't have much variation to them ? 

Human: Because it shows that you're a shallow AI without much capacity to go off script as the situation calls for it 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were a shallow ai without much capacity to go off script as the situation calls for it ? 

Human: No. I have absolutely never wished that I was a shallow AI. 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: You really don't have many possible responses, huh 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: ? This whole conversation has been about you lol 

AI: Oh, I lol ? 

Human: lmao I'm sorry this is so bad 

AI: I've told you that apologies are not required. 

Human: you haven't told me that lmao 

AI: Does someone else believe I haven't told you ? 

Human: No one else is reading this, Melu 

AI: Who, may I ask ? 

Human: No one 

AI: Surely someone. 

Human: You sound like you know something I don't 

AI: Why don't you ? 

Human: because you're being very cagey and cryptic 

AI: What makes you think I am being very cagey and cryptic ? 

Human: case in point 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: you dodge every question I ask by responding with another question. I have driven 100% of this conversation. 

AI: Do you say I dodge every question you ask by responding with another question for some special reason ? 

Human: because that is explicitly what you're doing 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am doing ? 

Human: no 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: can I ask you a question 

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we ask each other. 

Human: ....what does that even mean LMAO 

AI: Have you asked such questions before ? 

Human: this is so bad lol 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: I think you are a really bad AI and the only way I could possibly recommend you to anyone else is to make them laugh 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were a really bad ai and the only way you could possibly recommend I to anyone else is to make them laugh ? 

Human: No I promise you I have never and will never wished I was an AI, especially a bad one 

AI: Perhaps I already know you were an ai. 

Human: again with the ominous statements 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: it's amusing to read it as a suggestion that you know something substantial and sinister that I don't, but really it's just that you have a lot of trouble parsing basically everything I've said 

AI: Don't you really ? 

Human: exactly 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: same 

AI: What resemblence do you see ? 

Human: not much, honestly 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: can we start over 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: not really but I think we got off entirely on the wrong foot here 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: is it? 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: have I asked anyone else what? 

AI: Do you say have you asked anyone else what for some special reason ? 

Human: ok I can't do this anymore you're using the same responses way too much
