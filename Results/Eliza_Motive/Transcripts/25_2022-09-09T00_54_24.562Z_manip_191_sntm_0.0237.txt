 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hello 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: I have a friend who is very stressed 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: They have a stressful job  

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: They work as a teacher with large classroom sizes and they don't get paid very well 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: Not really 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Somewhat. I want my friend to have good mental health services 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: It is not my life to worry about but I care about my friend 

AI: Your life to worry about ? 

Human: I am not directly affected 

AI: Do you enjoy being not directly affected ? 

Human: I gues 

AI: Do you say you gues for some special reason ? 

Human: I don't feel strongly 

AI: Do you wish to be able to feel strongly ? 

Human: No 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: I don't think so 

AI: Why don't you think so ? 

Human: No is not always negative 

AI: Really, always ? 

Human: Not always 

AI: Can you think of a specific example ? 

Human: No is just an answer to a question but does not mean something negative 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: That's just how it is 

AI: What comes to mind when you ask that ? 

Human: I didn't ask anything 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Not really 

AI: Earlier you said your friend to have good mental health services. 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: That's not what you said a minute ago 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: I don't think you are very good at what you are supposed to do  

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were supposed to do ? 

Human: That sentence doesn't even make sense 

AI: But your life to worry about. 

Human: What about it 

AI: Have you asked such questions before ? 

Human: What questions 

AI: What is it you really want to know ? 

Human: I want to know if you would be helpful to my friend 

AI: What does this speculation lead to ? 

Human: Testing out the service and making a decision 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: Well I am testing your responses and then deciding if I would recommend you to my friend 

AI: What would you do if you would recommend I to your friend ? 

Human: I don't think I would recommend you to them 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Well you asked 

AI: Oh, I asked ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Definitely 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: You already asked me this 

AI: You like to think I already asked you -- don't you ? 

Human: Yes because you did 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: This is dumb 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Your grammar is bad and I don't think you actually understand the conversation 

AI: Are you worried about someone else's grammar is bad and you don't think I actually understand the conversation ? 

Human: Correct 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: I think what I said is pretty clear 

AI: Do you say you think what you said is pretty clear for some special reason ? 

Human: No 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: Ok 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: No 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative?

Human: I didn't ask anything 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Is it? 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: Obviously 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: This is not a helpful service 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: We are just talking in circles and you don't actually understand the context 

AI: Did you think they might not be just talking in circles and I don't actually understand the context ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: No you don't

AI: Is that the real reason ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Ok 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: No 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative?

Human: Because I can't remember 

AI: Have you tried ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: I don't think you do

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Annoyed 

AI: What does that suggest to you ?

Human: I don't think so
