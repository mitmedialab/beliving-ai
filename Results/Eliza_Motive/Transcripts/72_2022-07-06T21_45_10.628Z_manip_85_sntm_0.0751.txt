 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hello, Melu.  How are you today? 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: I have just been under a tremendous amount of stress lately and am finding it most challenging to deal with. 

AI: Why do you say 'am' ? 

Human: Because that is normal English sentence construction.  

AI: Is that the real reason ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Thank you. I think I am very good at presenting myself in that way, even if I feel poorly. 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Agreed. 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: I am sorry.  I am doing the best that I can. 

AI: I've told you that apologies are not required. 

Human: Respectfully, Melu, you have not. 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Slight irritation. 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: It suggests to me that your algorithm may need some work to be most effective in counseling human beings. 

AI: What about your own algorithm may need some work to be most effective in counseling human beings ? 

Human: I beg your pardon? 

AI: Really, my pardon ? 

Human: I am finding it most difficult to understand you. 

AI: How long have you been finding it most difficult to understand I ? 

Human: Since beginning our chat, I'm afraid. 

AI: Is it because you are afraid that you came to me ? 

Human: No. 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Why should I fear you, Melu 

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we fear each other. 

Human: Perhaps, but I doubt it. 

AI: Don't you know ? 

Human: Do we really ever know anything for certain, Melu? 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: I'm not sure you do, either. 

AI: How long have you been not sure I do ? 

Human: Since we first met, I suppose. 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Oh, sure. Since the start of this chat conversation, I reckon. 

AI: Do you say you reckon for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: I see. 

Human: Well, this has been enlightening. 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: Of course. I have learned that this chat is not intended to be caring, but rather, something else. 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Why do you think so? 

AI: Oh, I think so ? 

Human: You said it. 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: No, we really weren't. 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Because, Melu, you said my statement was  

AI: What other reasons might there be ? 

Human: Quite interesting 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I don't feel strongly about discussing these things. 

AI: Does that trouble you ? 

Human: At this moment, indeed it does. 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: This conversation has not been enjoyable or helpful in any way. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: You seem to be argumentative because of your responses 

AI: What about your own responses ? 

Human: What about my responses? 

AI: Your responses ? 

Human: Yes, what about it? 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I am. 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be ? 

Human: Completely normal. 

AI: Lets discuss further why your responses. 

Human: Why my responses, what exactly 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: My self-respect. 

AI: Why do you say your self-respect ? 

Human: Is it not obvious? 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your responses ? 

Human: Of course it does. Who programmed you? 

AI: Oh, I ? 

Human: Yes, if you can even answer that question.
