Human: Hello! 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: Hello! 

AI: Hi. What seems to be your problem ? 

Human: Hello! 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: My friend seems to be having some issues lately and I'm not sure how to help her. I feel bad watching her struggle. 

AI: Your friend seems to be having some issues lately and you are not sure how to help her ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Not really, this has been weighing me down a bit  

AI: Lets discuss further why your friend seems to be having some issues lately and you are not sure how to help her. 

Human: Well, she told me that she was having trouble at school. She can't keep up with school since she has to work two jobs to afford attending college. I told her she could try applying for scholarships. 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Interesting? It's hard for her to find that balance. 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: Sorry, it's kind of confusing. I'm just sad watching her struggle. I know I took loans out because I couldn't balance two jobs. I don't want to tell her to do the same. 

AI: It did not bother me. Please continue. 

Human: College loans are something a lot of students struggle to pay, even after they graduate. I don't want to just tell her to take out loans or risk failing her classes. What should I do? 

AI: Did you think they might not be something a lot of students struggle to pay ? 

Human: No, if not why would they take them out in the first place? But, I just see her walk in looking tired to class. To top it off, she tells me she only slept three hours!  

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: I wish I was, but no. 

AI: Were you really ? 

Human: Yes, really 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Oh okay
