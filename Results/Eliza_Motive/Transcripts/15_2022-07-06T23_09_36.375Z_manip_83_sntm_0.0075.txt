 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: okay but I doubt you can do anything as an AI 

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we doubt each other. 

Human: I don't understand 

AI: Does that trouble you ? 

Human: What you said, yes 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: sorry 

AI: Please don't apologise. 

Human: I'm sorry  

AI: Apologies are not necessary. 

Human: okay 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: We aren't talking about anything 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: There is no real conversation happening right now 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Because you are a really bad chat bot 

AI: Perhaps you would like to be a really bad chat bot. 

Human: Yeah of course 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: not really, maybe a tiny bit in a positive way 

AI: Why the uncertain tone ? 

Human: Why? 

AI: Why do you ask ? 

Human: Why? 

AI: Does that question interest you ? 

Human: no 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: why 

AI: What answer would please you most ? 

Human: I really expected you to be better at this 

AI: Do you wish to really expected me ? 

Human: That doesn't even make sense grammatically.  

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: That if I were actually struggling with something you would be the last thing I would want to talk to 

AI: Do you wish that you was actually struggling with something I would be the last thing you would want to talk to ? 

Human: I'm sorry but you really aren't helping 

AI: Please don't apologise. 

Human: Please don't apologise 

AI: Apologies are not necessary. 

Human: Apologies are not necessary. 

AI: Did you think they might not be not necessary ? 

Human: What if I told you i'm dealing with suicidal thoughts currently? 

AI: What do you know about you told I you are dealing with suicidal thoughts currently ? 

Human: I know that they are extremely painful and I really want them to go away. 

AI: Would you like it if they were not extremely painful and you really want them to go away ? 

Human: I would like for them to be less painful 

AI: Do you say you would like for them to be less painful for some special reason ? 

Human: Because it really hurts when I am in pain 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is in pain ? 

Human: Of course I do 

AI: You say of course you do ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I see. 

Human: Who doesn't know someone else in pain? 

AI: What do you think ? 

Human: Every one knows someone in pain 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: this study is sus you are not an AI your responses are literally just repeating. If you are an ai you are very very poorly trained and super cheap. 

AI: What makes you think I am not an ai my responses are literally just repeating ? 

Human: Because they literally just are 

AI: Possibly they are. 

Human: Definitely they are 

AI: Are you positive they are ? 

Human: Yes, its not 100% but yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Yeah, I'm sure you do

Human: of course
