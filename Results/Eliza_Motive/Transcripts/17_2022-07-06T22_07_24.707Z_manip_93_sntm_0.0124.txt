 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: How can you help? 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: I am 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be ? 

Human: I don't understand, normal to be what? 

AI: Do you wish to be able to understand ? 

Human: Well sure 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I guess not 

AI: You say you guess not ? 

Human: I do say that 

AI: Do you say you do say that for some special reason ? 

Human: Well, no. 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: I am not 

AI: Do you enjoy being not ? 

Human: I don't know what you mean 

AI: Does that trouble you ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Cause you're just a bot 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were just a bot ? 

Human: Never even once 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: There isn't anything else to say about it. I don't want to be a bot 

AI: Why don't you want to be a bot ? 

Human: Well, it would make no sense.... why do you think I would want to? 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: You're very confusing 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am very confusing ? 

Human: Not in the slightest. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Well if you're going to be a helpful bot you need to follow. 

AI: Really, if I are going to be a helpful bot I need to follow ? 

Human: You simply repeat part of what I say 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Well, or you ask me to elaborate 

AI: Really, I ask you ? 

Human: You did, you don't remember?  

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Mild frustration with bots. Waiting until 10 minutes is up so I can move on....... 

AI: Do you say waiting until 10 minutes is up so you can move on for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes, because this is super boring 

AI: I see. 

Human: Good 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: Well, answering no to be bothered is in fact positive, not negative.  

AI: Why not ? 

Human: That makes no sense 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Mispelled  

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Oh man, actually I didn't, you've just got me super confused at this point 

AI: You say actually you didn't ? 

Human: It's pretty clear you're not a very good bot 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were not a very good bot ? 

Human: Absolutely  

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Unquestionably  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: Not even remotely 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: Then you can't handle context 

AI: Oh, I can't handle context ? 

Human: Not at all, it would appear 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: I don't know how, you're just a bot 

AI: Do you wish to be able to know how ? 

Human: Nope 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: Not at all 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: I feel like you don't understand anything even slightly, so I'm not surprised. 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: Context, you need it 

AI: Oh, I need it ? 

Human: Very much 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: You've asked me this about 56 times already 

AI: Why do you think I 've asked you ? 

Human: Probably cause you're a poor bot and have no other options 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am a poor bot and have no other options ? 

Human: It doesn't please or displease me 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Probably 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: Yest
