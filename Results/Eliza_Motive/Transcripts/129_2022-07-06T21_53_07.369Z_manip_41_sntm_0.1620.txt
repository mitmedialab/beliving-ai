 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Great! So do you specialize in any one particular condition? 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: What do you mean by that? 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Me? Actually I'm searching for a mental companion for a close friend of mine. 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is searching for a mental companion for a close friend of mine ? 

Human: No... 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Ha-ha-ha, you're funny! 

AI: Perhaps you would like to be funny. 

Human: I'm already funny, but my friend is very depressed, and could use your help. 

AI: Is it because you are already funny that you came to me ? 

Human: NO....m 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No.... My friend needs someone to help him work through his depression.... 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: I don't know what that means! 

AI: Why don't you know what that means ? 

Human: It doesn't really make much sense. 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your friend needs professional mental help ? 

Human: Not in my opinion. 

AI: Why do you say your opinion ? 

Human: Ok now, tell me how to cure depression. 

AI: Why do you ask ? 

Human: My friend needs help. 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: Nope! 

AI: Earlier you said your friend needs help. 

Human: Exactly! 

AI: But your opinion. 

Human: I thought you were going to be able to help with a depressed person. 

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we thought each other. 

Human: WHAT????? 

AI: Have you asked anyone else ? 

Human: Not as of yet, but I guess I'll have to after chatting with you! 

AI: Do you wish to 'll have to after chatting with me ? 

Human: Do I wish what?? 

AI: You say do you wish what ? 

Human: Wow, you're pretty much useless, huh??
