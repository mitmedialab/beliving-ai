 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi Melu. How are you today? 

AI: Do you sometimes think I am today ? 

Human: That is interesting. That thought has never crossed my mind.  

AI: Why do you say your mind ? 

Human: That is what I use to process my thoughts.  

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: I don't believe so. 

AI: Do you wish to be able to believe so ? 

Human: Sometimes I would like to believe. I am agnostic and have been for many years. I grew up in a catholic house hold but I didn't feel like religion was that important to me.  

AI: You say sometimes you would like to believe ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yes I am sure.  

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be sure ? 

Human: Being a non-believer definitely makes you an outlier. 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: I know. I should have phrased it differently. 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Lately I have been feeling somewhat anxious. I sleep poorly and my appetite is not the same.  

AI: Do you say lately you have been feeling somewhat anxious for some special reason ? 

Human: Part of it is because I am stressed out at work and it seems like I have a lot of tasks to attend to but not a lot of help.  

AI: What other connections do you see ? 

Human: In order to reduce my work load I need to delegate tasks better and not put so much on my plate.  

AI: Is it important to you that you have your plate ? 

Human: Its a metaphorical plate but at the end of the day it is my plate so it is important.  

AI: Your plate so it is important ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: I understand. 

Human: How would you ask for help in case you needed it? 

AI: Oh, I needed it ? 

Human: The help yes not the plate.  

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I tend to be a positive person. There is no point in getting angry or worked up for no reason.  

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Looking back I was kind of an angry kid. As I got older I decided to not express my anger so much.  

AI: Were you really ? 

Human: I would have some angry outbursts from time to time. I never fought people but I did let my anger control me from time to time. As I got older I would keep my anger in check. 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: I made the decision that being angry was a bad thing and expressing that anger was not necessary.  

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Thank you.  

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: Its an expression of gratitude. I appreciate the fact that I can chat with you without judgement.  

AI: Do you can chat with anyone else ? 

Human: Not so often actually. 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your plate ? 

Human: Yes actually. My plate interferes with being able to do stuff that I enjoy. 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yes I am sure. I need to improve my work life balance.  

AI: Do you enjoy being sure ? 

Human: At times no. 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Well I come across situations that are very uncertain and that uncertainty can slow me down . In those instances I need to be better about taking action and just getting things done.
