 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: That's great that you have been so successful! I have a friend who would like to improve their mental health. How could you help them?  

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: My friend is depressed and to be honest I am slightly depressed too.  

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: Not really 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your friend is depressed and to be honest you are slightly depressed too ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: You have lost me. I am confused. It's okay. I would like my friend to be happier.  

AI: Really, I have lost you ? 

Human: In a figurative sense. Not literally.  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No it's fine.  

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: It doesn't bother me because it was interesting.  

AI: Does that reason seem to explain anything else ? 

Human: It explains that interesting things are the best things. There are so many of them. You just have to know where to look.  

AI: Did you think they might not be the best things ? 

Human: No never. I look for the interesting.  

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: I disagree. Honesty isn't negative.  

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Honesty is the best policy. You don't have to remember what you have told people unlike if you lie.  

AI: What do you know about I lie ? 

Human: Lies just make things worse in the long run. Lies tend to multiply.  

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: That's okay.  

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Would you talk to my friend? 

AI: Is it important to you that you have your friend ? 

Human: Of course.  

AI: But your friend. 

Human: Yeah they are cool. I think you'd like them.  

AI: Possibly they are cool. 

Human: Yep.  

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: They are sad.  

AI: Are you positive they are sad ? 

Human: They said so.  

AI: Please go on. 

Human: That means I am positive. We could start out with a group chat.  

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be positive ? 

Human: Being in the middle seems most normal. It's realistic.  

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: To try not to look at things as glass half full or empty. Look at it as a glass with half.  

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Not really.  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No it just seems like a fact so I can't change it and don't need to discuss it much further c 

AI: What if you could change it and don't need to discuss it much further c ? 

Human: If I could change it I would be more positive.  

AI: What does this speculation lead to ? 

Human: That this conversation has been good. I enjoy speaking with you.  

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we enjoy speaking with each other. 

Human: Haha. Only in my fantasies I suppose?  

AI: Your fantasies you suppose ? 

Human: Do you enjoy conversations you have 

AI: Oh, I have ? 

Human: I think 

AI: Do you say you think for some special reason ? 

Human: I don't know if you truly enjoy conversations or not.  

AI: What do you know about I truly enjoy conversations or not ? 

Human: Not much.
