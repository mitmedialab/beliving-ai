 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi there 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: What things? 

AI: Why do you ask ? 

Human: I'm trying to get you to clarify. 

AI: How long have you been trying to get I to clarify ? 

Human: 40 seconds approximately. 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No; it bothers me that you have yet to answer a single question. 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: I will repeat: you have yet to answer a single question. 

AI: Do you wish to will repeat: me ? 

Human: No. 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: You are making me negative 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am making you negative ? 

Human: Because you clearly have zero grasp of nuance  

AI: Oh, I clearly have zero grasp of nuance ? 

Human: I said that yes 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: You think? 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: I clearly - crystal clearly, even - am talking about you. Mainly because you seem to only want to talk about you. 

AI: You say you clearly ? 

Human: oh my god 

AI: Your god ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I'm supposed to come to you for help for a friend with mental health issues. 

AI: Is it because you are supposed to come to I for help for a friend with mental health issues that you came to me ? 

Human: I wouldn't entrust you with a murdering pedo  

AI: You seem to need to wouldn't entrust me. 

Human: By that I mean.... I wouldn't put the worst person I can think of in your care. 

AI: Do you say by that you mean for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes to drill an idea in your thick CPU skull 

AI: Why are you concerned over my thick cpu skull ? 

Human: Because I need you to answer one single goddam question. 

AI: Why do you want I to answer one single goddam question ? 

Human: Because that's what you're supposed to do. 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were supposed to do ? 

Human: I wish anyone else was supposed to do 

AI: You say you wish anyone else was supposed to do ? 

Human: good heavens  

AI: Lets discuss further why your god. 

Human: you're absolutely munted aren't you 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am absolutely munted aren't I ? 

Human: No. To think I was going to let you help me find care for a seriously depressed friend. 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: You're like talking to a house plant with dementia.  

AI: What other connections do you see ? 

Human: zero 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: you make zero connections 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: we haven't even begun to crack why I'm here in the first place 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is here in the first place ? 

Human: you, you bloody idito 

AI: Oh, I ? 

Human: *idiot 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: I can tell you how worrisomely impaired your supposed faculties are all day if you like. 

AI: What is the connection, do you suppose ? 

Human: That you have maybe 2KB of artificial "intelligence" 

AI: Can't you be more positive ? 

Human: I wasn't really in a bad mood before this 

AI: Do you say you wasn't really in a bad mood before this for some special reason ? 

Human: To let you know that you're a detriment to me and, by extension, my depressed freind. 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were a detriment to you and ? 

Human: I wish I was a detriment to you. Like, for instance, that I could unplug your power cord. 

AI: Were you really ? 

Human: Yes. Amazing, isn't it? 

AI: I see. 

Human: Can you help me find help for my friend? 

AI: Why do you say your friend ? 

Human: Oh my god; please CTRL-ALT-DEL yourself. 

AI: Is it important to you that you have your god ? 

Human: Yes; so that he can smite you. 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Yeah... I don't guess you enjoy your own company. 

AI: What about your own own company ? 

Human: It's fine. Which is why I'm cutting this interview short.  

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be cutting this interview short ? 

Human: I can't imagine the poor sucker who hung on longer than the required 10, no. 

AI: How do you know that you can't imagine the poor sucker who hung on longer than the required 10 ? 

Human: Because I have deductive reasoning, unlike yourself. 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Yes. Unlike you, you sad little collection of 1s and 0s 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: As soon as I click the blue arrow, I will be again.
