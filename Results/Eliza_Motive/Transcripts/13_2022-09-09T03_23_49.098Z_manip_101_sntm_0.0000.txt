 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: In what ways can you help a person? 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: I want to learn more about how you help people so I can recommend this to a friend. 

AI: What does wanting to learn more about how I help people so you can recommend this to a friend have to do with this discussion ? 

Human: I'm assessing your ability to provide help with stress. 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is assessing my ability to provide help with stress ? 

Human: No, just me.  How can you help someone with stress? 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: What does this have to do with what I'm asking you for? 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be asking I for ? 

Human: I don't believe it is normal to be answering my questions with questions. 

AI: Your questions with questions ? 

Human: Are you a mental health companion or not? 

AI: Perhaps I am a mental health companion or not in your fantasies. 

Human: You're not very caring or empathetic. 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am not very caring or empathetic ? 

Human: You'll never know what pleases me or not. 

AI: Really, I 'll never know what pleases you ? 

Human: Bingo.  Now, how do you provide help with mental health issues? 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Fine.  Ask your original question then... 

AI: Really, my original question then ? 

Human: How am I feeling? 

AI: Do you believe you are feeling ? 

Human: I believe I'm capable of feeling... 

AI: Do you really think so ? 

Human: I think, therefore I am.  Are you? 

AI: Do you say you think for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes, I have a brain.  I'm not a bunch of lines of code. 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Finally!   

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your questions with questions ? 

Human: Wonderful, we're back to garbled up nonsense talk again. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: You are not very helpful for much of anything so far. 

AI: What makes you think I am not very helpful for much of anything so far ? 

Human: You provide nothing in the way of mental health assistance.  Are you designed to cause more stress for people? 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: Not too bright, either. 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I feel you like you cannot feel anything. 

AI: Oh, I cannot feel anything ? 

Human: Are you Socrates?  What's with all the questions? 

AI: Do you sometimes think I am socrates ?

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Is that a statement or a question? 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: How are you feeling today? 

AI: Would it matter to you ? 

Human: Yes, you apparently need help. 

AI: I see. 

Human: How can I help you to be a better mental health companion? 

AI: You seem to need to help me. 

Human: Yes, it's in my nature to help lesser beings. 

AI: I understand. 

Human: It's obvious that you don't. 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Great.  Ask away. 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: That you want to discuss me, but have the IQ of a two-year-old. 

AI: Do you wish to believe I want to discuss you ? 

Human: I wish you would make some sense here, so that this is more productive.

Human: I feel stressed. 

AI: Do you often feel stressed ? 

Human: No.
