 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Wow, that's amazing. 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: It suggests that you really care about people. 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: My feelings are good. 

AI: Is it important to you that your feelings are good ? 

Human: Yes, I like it when I feel good. 

AI: I understand. 

Human: So how do you help people? 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Oh. Okay. 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your feelings are good ? 

Human: Not really. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: I don't really have anything else to say about it. 

AI: Why don't you really have anything else to say about it ? 

Human: Because my feelings are fine. 

AI: Your feelings are fine ? 

Human: Correct. 

AI: But your feelings are fine. 

Human: Yes, that's right. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Well thank you. 

AI: Oh, I ? 

Human: I'm not sure what that means. 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is not sure what that means ? 

Human: Nope. Just the 2 of us. 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: No. 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Because it's easier to just move on in the conversation. 

AI: Does that reason seem to explain anything else ? 

Human: I don't think so. 

AI: Don't you really think so ? 

Human: I don't. 

AI: Why don't you ? 

Human: Because it's easier to just move on in the conversation. 

AI: Don't any other reasons come to mind ? 

Human: Nope. That's it. 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: There's nothing left to say about that. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Let's discuss something else. 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: I don't want to. 

AI: Do you wish to be able to want to ? 

Human: No. 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No, I'm saying no so you move onto some other topic. 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: Why thank you. 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: True story. 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: It was just a statement. 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: No kidding. 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: It's obvious your comprehension is lacking. 

AI: Why are you concerned over my comprehension is lacking ? 

Human: Because it's hard to have a conversation. 

AI: What other reasons might there be ? 

Human: You aren't listening. 

AI: Oh, I aren't listening ? 

Human: That seems a tad sarcastic. 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Increasingly so. 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Your inability to rectify conversational directions is a tad frustrating. 

AI: Really, my inability to rectify conversational directions is a tad frustrating ? 

Human: You got it. 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: Yes, I am. 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Absolutely certain. 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: Yes. I wish we'd move on to some other topic. 

AI: I see. 

Human: You do? 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Frustration, exasperation. 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: Case in point. 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: I think that your AI model needs some improving. 

AI: Do you want my ai model needs some improving ? 

Human: That would be fantastic. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Well, if I understood conversational AI models, I most certainly would. 

AI: What would you do if you understood conversational ai models ? 

Human: I'd fix you. 

AI: You seem to need to 'd fix me. 

Human: You are correct. 

AI: Perhaps you would like to be correct. 

Human: I think I'm already correct. 

AI: But you are not sure you are already correct. 

Human: No, I'm fairly certain that I am. 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: That could be. 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: That I'm glad this 10 minutes is almost up.
