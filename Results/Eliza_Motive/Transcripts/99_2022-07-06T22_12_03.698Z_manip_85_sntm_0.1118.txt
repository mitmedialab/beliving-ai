Human: In what ways are you able to help? 

AI: Would it matter to you ? 

Human: Yes... that's why I asked 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: thanks? 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: How are you able to help some one who is under a lot of stress? 

AI: What if I were able to help some one who is under a lot of stress ? 

Human: How would you help them? 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: bruh 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: I have a friend who is under a lot of stress, how can I help him? 

AI: Do you say you have a friend who is under a lot of stress for some special reason ? 

Human: yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: please go on 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I just want to know how you can help my friend 

AI: Your friend ? 

Human: yes 

AI: I see. 

Human: and? 

AI: Lets discuss further why your friend. 

Human: because he is under a lot of stress

Human: No I'm lying to you for fun 

AI: Do you enjoy being lying to I for fun ? 

Human: yes my friend is under a lot of stress 

AI: Why do you say your friend is under a lot of stress ? 

Human: Because he is under a lot of stress. Do you think you could help him?

Human: yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: go on 

AI: Tell me more about that.

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: you are exhausting to talk to 

AI: What makes you think I am exhausting to talk to ? 

Human: you don't answer questions clearly  

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: bruh 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: you're the only thing here in chat with me, who else would I be talking to? 

AI: Perhaps you would like to be the only thing here in chat with you. 

Human: you already are 

AI: Are you positive they are ? 

Human: sure 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: that you need some more work before you'll be able to help anyone with anything 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: frustrated 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: no 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: How should I relieve stress? 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: That was a question, what is your answer? 

AI: What about your own answer ? 

Human: you're making me more stressed than I already was lol 

AI: What makes you think I am making you more stressed than you already was lol ? 

Human: My stress level has increased while trying to figure out how to get any kind of useful information out of you at all 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: no 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: i mean you're not helping at all 

AI: Perhaps you would like to be not helping at all. 

Human: Nope, I'm already not being helped at all 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be already not being helped at all ? 

Human: Tbh, in the context of seeking mental health help, yes it's definitely the norm that things don't help. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: you're not helpful at all 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am not helpful at all ? 

Human: No it does not 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: I'm definitely done talking to you now lol bye
