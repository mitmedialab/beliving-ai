 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: hello Melu 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: It's not my problem, I'm doing research for a friend 

AI: Why do you say your problem ? 

Human: You asked me to state my problem 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: Yes, my rapidly dwindling patience with this AI 

AI: I see. 

Human: how do you diagnose depression? 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: my friend is depressed 

AI: Is it important to you that your friend is depressed ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Can you help? 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: I really am 

AI: I don't understand that. 

Human: I'm sure there are many things you don't understand, Melu 

AI: Is it because you are sure there are many things I don't understand that you came to me ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Pressure, stress, anxiety 

AI: But your friend is depressed. 

Human: yes 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: fairly sure, yeah 

AI: Earlier you talked about your problem. 

Human: I didn't, actually 

AI: Do you say you didn't for some special reason ? 

Human: Accuracy 

AI: Lets discuss further why your problem. 

Human: Okay 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I'm frightened 

AI: How long have you been frightened ? 

Human: for as long as I can remember 

AI: You say for as long as you can remember ? 

Human: Have other patients perhaps remarked on how ineffective you are? 

AI: Don't you know ? 

Human: I don't, which is why I asked the question 

AI: Do you wish to be able to ? 

Human: Yes, which is why I asked the question 

AI: I understand. 

Human: And yet... 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: This is excruciating 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: In general, no, but with you, absolutely yes 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: Agreed! 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Why should my friend use you? 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: No 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Because "no" is the appropriate and correct answer to your question "Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you?" 

AI: What makes you think of my question "does that suggest anything else which belongs to I ? 

Human: Yeah, getting a little mixed up there, aren't we, Melu? 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your friend use I ? 

Human: It has EVERYTHING to do with that fact 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: I'm looking for help for my friend. You were recommended (for reasons that elude me) 

AI: Why do you say your friend ? 

Human: My friend needs help 

AI: Your friend needs help ? 

Human: yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I am 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be ? 

Human: I do 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Because I've already explained this at least twice before. You're just not getting it. 

AI: Do you say because you've already explained this at least twice before for some special reason ? 

Human: Again, chalk it up to my crazy preference for accuracy 

AI: Is it important to you that your crazy preference for accuracy ? 

Human: If then else 

AI: Really, if then else ? 

Human: Absolutely 

AI: Lets discuss further why your friend. 

Human: Has it been ten minutes yet?
