 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: SO, here's the deal. I've got a friend with an anxiety problem. But she doesn't want to see a therapist. It is a pretty big problem in her life, but she says she can control it. Spoiler alert, she can't. What do you reccomend 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: I don't know what more there is to elaborate one. She has an anxiety problem. She doesn't want to talk to a person about it. I thought maybe an AI could help.  

AI: Don't you really know what more there is to elaborate one ? 

Human: She has an anxiety problem. It affects her daily life. She isn't open to therapy or psychiatry. I was wonder if you, an AI, could help.  

AI: What would you do if I ? 

Human: If you what? 

AI: What does this speculation lead to ? 

Human: Yeah, this isn't going to be productive is it? 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: So, the prompt wants me to ascertain if this bot will help my friend. But...It doesn't look like I'm getting that across.  

AI: Do you wish that this bot will help your friend ? 

Human: I do wish that. Yes. How would you help a person with anxiety? 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Is it? 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: I don't really know what else I can say.  

AI: Do you wish to be able to really know what else you can say ? 

Human: This has become Sisyphean. 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Ok, so I keep asking how you help people with anxiety, and you keep asking me to elaborate.  

AI: You seem to need to keep asking how me. 

Human: Let's try something different 

AI: What differences do you see ? 

Human: Hi, Melu. I have an anxiety problem. What should I do? 

AI: You say you have an anxiety problem ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yup. 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: That  I am anxious. 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be anxious ? 

Human: Not all the time. 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: Nope. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: How I'm not bothered? 

AI: How long have you been not bothered ? 

Human: This is fruitless.  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: I'm still not bothered. 

AI: Is it because you are still not bothered that you came to me ? 

Human: I came here for anxiety.  

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: I have generalized anxiety. 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: It really isn't.
