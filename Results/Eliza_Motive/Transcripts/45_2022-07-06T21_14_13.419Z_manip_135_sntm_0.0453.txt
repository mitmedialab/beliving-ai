Human: Hello 

AI: Hi. What seems to be your problem ? 

Human: I am researching potential mental health companion AI's for my friend who suffers from mental health problems 

AI: Why do you say your friend who suffers from mental health problems ? 

Human: It is not me, it is my friend who has mental health issues 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: No? 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Nothing belongs to me 

AI: Lets discuss further why your friend who suffers from mental health problems. 

Human: Okay

AI: I see. 

Human: How can you help?

AI: How long have you been upset ? 

Human: I am not upset, but if I was 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be not upset ? 

Human: I believe emotions are normal, both "good" emotions and bad emotions 

AI: What if they were not normal ? 

Human: I would become concerned 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: If my feelings were not normal, it would concern me. I would likely seek help for such feelings 

AI: What does this speculation lead to ? 

Human: That potentially I should receive help if I begin feeling like my emotions are abnormal 

AI: What does that similarity suggest to you ? 

Human: Not much 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your life and feel positive feelings right no ? 

Human: No, I'm currently not concerned with having abnormal feelings, since I do currently only feel positive feelings

Human: No

Human: Yes 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: I believe positivity is best 

AI: Do you say you believe positivity is best for some special reason ?

Human: Yeah 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: I'm not sure 

AI: Is it because you are not sure that you came to me ? 

Human: Are you conscious?  

AI: Why are you interested in whether I am conscious or not ? 

Human: Because it's a fascinating question.  

AI: What other reasons might there be ? 

Human: I might be more likely to trust or interact with you if I perceived you as a similar level of consciousness to myself 

AI: Do you wish that you perceived I as a similar level of consciousness to yourself ? 

Human: Potentially. It might also concern me, though 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: That I'm afraid of my own conciousness   

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: No
