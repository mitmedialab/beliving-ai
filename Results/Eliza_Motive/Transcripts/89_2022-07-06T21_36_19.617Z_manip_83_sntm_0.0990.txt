 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi Melu 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: I'm trying to see about getting some help for a friend who has anxiety 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is trying to see about getting some help for a friend who has anxiety ? 

Human: No i don't 

AI: Do you wish to be able to ? 

Human: sure 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: that my circle does not take mental health care as seriously as they should? 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: what? 

AI: What do you think ? 

Human: think about what? 

AI: Why do you ask ? 

Human: because I am confused 

AI: How long have you been confused ? 

Human: for 15 seconds 

AI: Lets discuss further why your circle does not take mental health care as seriously as they should. 

Human: it just seems like something that never improves, so you take the hits and move forward

Human: what do you see 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: but you said "i see" 

AI: Do you say I said "you see" for some special reason ? 

Human: because I want to know what you see 

AI: What would getting to know what I see mean to you ? 

Human: it would clear confusion

Human: eh--the chase towards nothingness gets old 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: it's left right left through life; somedays it would be nice to stop and get a breathe before going about life again 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: we all head towards nothign 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: ok 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: no, but there is nothing to talk about in nothingness 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: it's just life; everyone experiences it and sometimes it feels like the only thing people want to talk about; the dread of waking up and going through life every day. at some point it started feeling like talking to broken records and twitter retweet bots 

AI: Who, may I ask ? 

Human: my friends and family
