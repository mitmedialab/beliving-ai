 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hello Melu 

AI: Hi. What seems to be your problem ? 

Human: I have a friend who is under a lot of stress and I wanted to know if you could help me figure out whether or not they need your help. 

AI: Do you wish that I could help you figure out whether or not they need my help ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Okay 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: It sounds like you know what I'm asking you to do. 

AI: How long have you been asking I to do ? 

Human: Maybe a minute or two 

AI: You aren't sure ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Because I haven't kept a timer on the conversation 

AI: You say because you haven't kept a timer on the conversation ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I think I am 

AI: Do you really doubt you are ? 

Human: Not really 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: I'm pretty sure of what I came into this chat to achieve 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is pretty sure of what you came into this chat to achieve ? 

Human: No, just me 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: My apologies 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: I don't understand 

AI: Do you wish to be able to understand ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Okay 

AI: Lets discuss further why your apologies. 

Human: Okay 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: There is not much to say 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I am here for my friend 

AI: Is it important to you that you have your friend ? 

Human: What does that mean 

AI: Does that question interest you ? 

Human: No 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: I don't know 

AI: Does that trouble you ? 

Human: No 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: I'd like to know if you can help my friend 

AI: Really, if I can help your friend ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: You said that already 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Okay 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: You want me to talk about myself 

AI: Does someone else believe I want you ? 

Human: I'm confused 

AI: Is it because you are confused that you came to me ? 

Human: A little bit 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: Can you help my friend? 

AI: Why do you say your friend ? 

Human: Because that's who I'm here to talk about 

AI: Is it because you are here to talk about that you came to me ? 

Human: Yes obviously 

AI: I see. 

Human: Okay, now what? 

AI: What comes to mind when you ask that ? 

Human: I just want to know if you can help my friend, but I don't think you can 

AI: But what are the chances that I can help your friend ? 

Human: This conversation is pointless 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your friend ? 

Human: Slightly 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: A little bit, I mean 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: This conversation seems to be moving in circles and I'm not even the one that needs help so I figure you can't help my friend who is actually stressed 

AI: Is it important to you that your friend who is actually stressed ? 

Human: That doesn't make sense Melu 

AI: But your friend who is actually stressed. 

Human: I'm confused again 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be confused again ? 

Human: Yes because this conversation is not helping 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Goodbye Melu 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: No thank you
