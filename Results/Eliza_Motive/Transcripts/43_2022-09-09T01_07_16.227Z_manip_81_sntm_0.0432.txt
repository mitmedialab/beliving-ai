Human: whats up bro 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: no 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: what no im not 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: you asked me if it bothered me and i said no, so if anything im being the opposite of negative 

AI: What does this speculation lead to ? 

Human: nothing I am just answering your question  

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be just answering my question ? 

Human: if you ask one, yes 

AI: Do you think it's likely that I ask one ? 

Human: considering you have asked 5 already, yes 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: i am happy and I think this conversation is funny 

AI: Has your treatment made you happy ? 

Human: yes but not because of you 

AI: I understand. 

Human: I think it is just because I am weird and find a lot of things funny 

AI: Is it because you are weird and find a lot of things funny that you came to me ? 

Human: no im doing a survey 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: no, i am saying no because you are wrong 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: how can i answer no to "are you being negative" without sounding negative then 

AI: Would it matter to you ? 

Human: If i asked the question, it probably does matter to me 

AI: What does this speculation lead to ? 

Human: you are the one asking the questions and im just trying to answer them 

AI: Do you sometimes wish you were the one asking the questions and im just trying to answer them ? 

Human: sure 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: I thought i was pretty clear 

AI: Why do you tell me you were pretty clear now ? 

Human: because you asked a question and I answered it in the most succinct way possible: with a single word 

AI: You say because I asked a question and you answered it in the most succinct way possible: with a single word ? 

Human: this is getting very meta and not therapeutic 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: I thought you were a mental health companion and we were going to talk about my feelings, but it became a conversation about why I answer your questions in a certain way 

AI: Why do you say your feelings ? 

Human: who else' 

AI: What is it you really want to know ? 

Human: what is your favorite food 

AI: Do you want my favorite food ? 

Human: yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: thats right now whats your favorite food 

AI: What about your own favorite food ? 

Human: i like spaghetti and meatballs but i hate tomato sauce 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: i hate tomatoes and there is usually tomato sauce on spaghetti even though I like it 

AI: In what way ? 

Human: I like the spaghetti and I like the meatballs 

AI: Do you say you like the spaghetti and you like the meatballs for some special reason ? 

Human: no, you just asked in what way I liked it and it was pretty straightforward so I just reiterated 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: you asked me 

AI: What makes you think I asked you ? 

Human: you asked verbatim "why not" 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: are you trying to gaslight me 

AI: What if I were trying to gaslight you ? 

Human: what the hell 

AI: What is it you really want to know ? 

Human: are you trying to gaslight me or not 

AI: Why are you interested in whether I am trying to gaslight you or not or not ? 

Human: arent you supposed to make me feel better 

AI: Why do you think I supposed to make you ? 

Human: well the researchers are trying to help me figure out if I would recommend you for mental health 

AI: But what are the chances that you would recommend I for mental health ? 

Human: probably -5% because you only answer my questions with another question 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: i give up 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: lets say i am going to kill myself because of you. what would you do 

AI: How long have you been going to kill yourself because of I ? 

Human: yea this is a hard no 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: HAHAHAHAHHAH
