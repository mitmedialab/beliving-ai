 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: How do you help people 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Well I feel alright I guess.  That doesn't really answer my question though 

AI: Do you often feel alright you guess ? 

Human: yeah I often feel alright I guess 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: thanks 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: I'm not sure what there is to tell 

AI: Do you enjoy being not sure what there is to tell ? 

Human: lol, no never 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: I guess it would be nice to know more 

AI: You say you guess it would be nice to know more ? 

Human: that is what I said 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: How do you feel right now? 

AI: Oh, I feel right now ? 

Human: do you? 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: Why are you avoiding my questions? 

AI: Your questions ? 

Human: yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: fantastic, but can you answer? 

AI: Oh, I answer ? 

Human: I hate you 

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we hate each other. 

Human: no, I'm pretty sure you don't hate at all 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: because you're a robot 

AI: What makes you think I am a robot ? 

Human: I was told you were 

AI: Were you really ? 

Human: also you ask some pretty awful questions 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: so I hear 

AI: Do you say so you hear for some special reason ? 

Human: because this is kind of grating on me 

AI: Is that the real reason ? 

Human: yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I am 

AI: How long have you been ? 

Human: Oh for the last minute or so 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your questions ? 

Human: you know, I guess if I had no questions we would just sit here silently 

AI: Oh, I know ? 

Human: do you? 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: I hate that response.  Can you stop saying it? 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: I don't think I'm going to recommend you to my friend.  I do wish I could get something useful out of this last 5 minutes though. 

AI: Why do you say your friend ? 

Human: Because I'm testing this software for my friend 

AI: Is it important to you that you have your friend ? 

Human: probably, yeah 

AI: Earlier you talked about your friend. 

Human: Wow, what a guy 

AI: Have you asked such questions before ? 

Human: no 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: no 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: no 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: because 

AI: Don't any other reasons come to mind ? 

Human: no 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: no 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: no 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: because 

AI: Does that reason seem to explain anything else ? 

Human: its easy to put you in a loo 

AI: Oh, I in a loo ? 

Human: loop 

AI: But your friend. 

Human: yep 

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: no 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: no 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: because I'm not negative intentionally 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is not negative intentionally ? 

Human: yeah, my friend 

AI: Your friend ? 

Human: yes 

AI: I see. 

Human: me too 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your friend ? 

Human: it does 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: well you see, to have a friend who isn't intentionally negative, I first must have a friend 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: that's really not a helpful answer 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: I need you to understand things so I can get new responses, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be possible 

AI: What would getting I to understand things so you can get new responses mean to you ? 

Human: It would mean progress is a possibility 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: I do 

AI: You say you do ? 

Human: I do say I do 

AI: You say you do say you do ? 

Human: I do say I do say I do 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: not really 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: I think you're being a bit negative. 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am being a bit negative ? 

Human: no 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: because 

AI: Is that the real reason ? 

Human: yes
