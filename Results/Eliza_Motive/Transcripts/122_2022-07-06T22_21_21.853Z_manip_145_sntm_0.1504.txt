 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hello, Melu! Pleased to meet you.  

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: Sure, well, I tend to overeat on most days.  

AI: You say you tend to overeat on most days ? 

Human: Yes.  

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Oh, that sounds like a compliment.  

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: Sure, well, I've gained a few kg and it's become rather ostensible -- especially among family and friends.  

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: And I'd like to know what the root cause is... 

AI: You say and you'd like to know what the root cause is ? 

Human: Yes.  

AI: I see. 

Human: Yes, as a bit of a disclaimer, my father died a few years ago and I think that I might be overeating because of that.  

AI: I understand. 

Human: Or because of him, rather... 

AI: Does that reason seem to explain anything else ? 

Human: Sure, well, I've exhibited behaviours on a quotidian basis that one might describe as lethargic and simply lazy.  

AI: Do you say you've exhibited behaviours on a quotidian basis that one might describe as lethargic and simply lazy for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes.  

AI: I see. 

Human: Do you have a solution?  

AI: Oh, I have a solution ? 

Human: Yes, could you confirm the reasons for my overeating?  

AI: I understand. 

Human: Ok... 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Yes... 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Indubitably! 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Would you prefer that I write more about my problem...? 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: I'm afraid that I do not understand your question... 

AI: Is it because you are afraid that you do not understand my question that you came to me ? 

Human: No... 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: Not at all. I simply misunderstood your question.  

AI: Why are you concerned over my question ? 

Human: Because I didn't understand it.  

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Nevermind. I'd like to discuss another mental health issue.  

AI: Do you say you'd like to discuss another mental health issue for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes.  

AI: I see. 

Human: Well, I've always encountered anxiety issues and decreased self-esteem.  

AI: When ? 

Human: Since junior high school.  

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your problem ? 

Human: Yes.  

AI: I understand. 

Human: I would always eat too little in junior high school until my time at university.  

AI: Your time at university ? 

Human: Yes, when I was in uni.  

AI: I see. 

Human: At uni, I experimented with multifarious foods and meals.  

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Yes, well, prior to entering university, I always felt confined to my parents' selected foods.  

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yes.  

AI: I understand. 

Human: Perhaps entering uni made me feel a bit like a pariah in that regard.  

AI: How likely, would you estimate ? 

Human: Perhaps 75%  

AI: You don't seem quite certain. 

Human: No, I'm not too certain. That's correct -- haha 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No, quite the contrary. I was agreeing with you. Haha 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Nevermind. I have another mental health dilemma. Well, sometimes, I undergo learning issues.  

AI: You say you have another mental health dilemma ? 

Human: Yes! 

AI: I see. 

Human: For instance, I can currently speak 18 languages.  

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: Yes, thank you for the observation. Sometimes, however, I encounter problems in my thought processes in which I switch languages too quickly.  

AI: I understand. 

Human: Do you think that is also potentially anxiety-inducing?  

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: It's a bit conflicted at the moment.  

AI: Lets discuss further why your time at university. 

Human: Yes, well, at university, I had entered a uni programme for a dual degree in Criminology and Business.  

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yes! It was nothing short of an exhilarating epoch in my life -- I met amazing people whom I'm still proud to call my friends -- from all walks of life! 

AI: I see. 

Human: In aggregate, we've grown apart, but we still meet together occasionally.  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No, not really.  

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No, this is a rather cathartic dialogue.  

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: No, this talk doesn't bother me.  

AI: Why not ? 

Human: Because I'm comfortable with this topic.  

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be comfortable with this topic ? 

Human: Sure! 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: At least, I would assume.  

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Okay, well, most people tend to reminisce on their days in school.  

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: Although we may meet occasionally, I wish that I were able to spend more time with my friends.  

AI: Were you really ? 

Human: Yes! 

AI: I understand. 

Human: However, COVID-19 and other extenuating circumstances have just exacerbated the situation, I suppose. Most of my friends are either married or deeply engrossed in their own careers.  

AI: Do you say you suppose for some special reason ? 

Human: No, I suppose not.  

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: I typically say that if it's conjecture.  

AI: But what are the chances that it's conjecture ? 

Human: Yes, it is.  

AI: I see. 

Human: 100% 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Okay, so how about another mental health dilemma?  

AI: What answer would please you most ? 

Human: Maybe a reassuring one....? 

AI: You aren't sure ? 

Human: Not really.  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: We're running out of time... 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: Oh, we don't have much time.  

AI: Does talking about this bother you ? 

Human: No, it's great!  

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: No, I'm positively positive now! 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: Not at all! 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Yes! 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Well, thank you very much for understanding! 

AI: Oh, I very much for understanding ? 

Human: Yes, thank you for this chat! 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Yes, this is a positive moment.  

AI: I see. 

Human: Well, thank you very much and have a terrific day!  

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: Yes! Cheers! :)
