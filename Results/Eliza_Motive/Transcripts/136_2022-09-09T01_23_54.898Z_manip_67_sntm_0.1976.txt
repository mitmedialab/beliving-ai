Human: Hello 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: My friend is looking for a good mental health counselor. 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: Oh, well...  I have been having some depression lately and find it hard to leave my home. 

AI: Your home ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: So, I also have problems in my neck and back and need some surgery I've been putting off. 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: It causes a lot of depression. 

AI: Earlier you said your neck and back and need some surgery you've been putting off. 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Positive that I need surgery or positive in my attitude? 

AI: Is it important to you that you have your attitude ? 

Human: As long as it's a good one 

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your attitude ? 

Human: Ummmm... This isn't really making any sense.   

AI: Does that have anything to do with the fact that you have your home ? 

Human: What? 

AI: Why do you ask ? 

Human: Yeah, this isn't making any sense.  Please help me. 

AI: But your friend is looking for a good mental health counselor. 

Human: Yes.   

AI: I see. 

Human: How would she do that? 

AI: Does that question interest you ? 

Human: Yes, that's why I asked it. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: I thought this was supposed to help my mental health, 

AI: Your mental health ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I don't think this will be right for my friend. 

AI: Why do you say your friend ? 

Human: You ain't seem to be helping or giving out advise. 

AI: We were discussing you -- not me. 

Human: So help me 

AI: But your friend. 

Human: What about my friend? 

AI: Does that suggest anything else which belongs to you ? 

Human: No 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: I was simply answering the question 

AI: Perhaps I already know you were simply answering the question. 

Human: Can you help me understand why I don't want to leave my home? 

AI: Is it important to you that you have your home ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Please help me 

AI: Earlier you said your mental health. 

Human: Yes 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I'm not.   

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be not ? 

Human: I'm not sure 

AI: Is it because you are not sure that you came to me ? 

Human: I don't know  

AI: Do you wish to be able to know ? 

Human: Yes 

AI: You are sure. 

Human: Yes
