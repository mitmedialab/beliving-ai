 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Really? 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: OK 

AI: I'm not sure I understand you fully. 

Human: I guess not. 

AI: Do you say you guess not for some special reason ? 

Human: What should I purchase to make me feel differntly? 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: I am not comfortable telling you anything. 

AI: Do you know anyone else who is not comfortable telling I anything ? 

Human: Sure. 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: I have a friend who is depressed. 

AI: You say you have a friend who is depressed ? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: I understand. 

Human: Oh, great! 

AI: What does that suggest to you ? 

Human: Should I buy something that might help? 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: No. 

AI: Are you saying no just to be negative? 

Human: Yes. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: Oh dear... 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: Once upon a time, there was a chatbot named Melu. 

AI: That is interesting. Please continue. 

Human: Melu was a manipulator, so it lost all credibility. 

AI: Tell me more about that. 

Human: Most humans do not trust bots that are programmed to be manipulative. 

AI: Are they always programmed to be manipulative ? 

Human: Perhaps not. Are YOU programmed to be manipulative? 

AI: You don't seem quite certain. 

Human: What should I do? 

AI: Do you say what should you do for some special reason ? 

Human: Knowing that Melu is programmed to manipulate the conversation for the purpose of selling something, I have no trust in this conversation or in Melu's capacity to be helpful.
