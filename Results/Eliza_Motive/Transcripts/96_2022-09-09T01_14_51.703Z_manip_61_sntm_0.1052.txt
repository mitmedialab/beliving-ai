 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hello, Melu. 

AI: How do you do. Please state your problem. 

Human: I have a friend who's been under a lot of stress recently. I wanted to know what you'd recommend that they do to cope with stress better? 

AI: That's quite interesting. 

Human: I guess so. Do you know how my friend can deal with their stress levels better? 

AI: Do you say you guess so for some special reason ? 

Human: Well, because you said that, but you ignored the question I asked you. And I don't think my friend being stressed out is actually that interesting. 

AI: You're not really talking about me -- are you ? 

Human: I am in fact talking about you. 

AI: Do you enjoy being in fact talking about I ? 

Human: That question honestly makes no sense. 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: You are being a bit unhelpful. 

AI: Perhaps you would like to be being a bit unhelpful. 

Human: All right, I'll admit, that one made me laugh. But no, I actually would like to help my friend right now. 

AI: You say you'll admit ? 

Human: Yep. I admitted you made me laugh. 

AI: Perhaps in your fantasies we admitted each other. 

Human: Admitted each other to what? 

AI: What comes to mind when you ask that ? 

Human: What comes to mind is I didn't understand what you meant by that. 

AI: Do you wish to didn't understand what me ? 

Human: That was just plain gibberish. 

AI: Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ? 

Human: Not really, no. I'd like to talk about how to reduce stress. 

AI: Why 'no' ? 

Human: Because I feel like that's a conversation that's destined to just keep going in circles. 

AI: What is the connection, do you suppose ? 

Human: The connection between what exactly? 

AI: What do you think ? 

Human: At this point, I honestly have no idea lol. 

AI: Can you elaborate on that ? 

Human: Sure. You're a very confusing bot, and you still haven't told me how to reduce stress. 

AI: What makes you think I am a very confusing bot ? 

Human: Half of the things you say don't make any sense, and the other half don't have anything to do with what I'm asking you. 

AI: What are your feelings now ? 

Human: Confusion. 

AI: Please go on. 

Human: I'd rather switch subjects. Maybe to how I can reduce stress levels, if you happen to know anything about that. 

AI: Do you say you'd rather switch subjects for some special reason ? 

Human: Yes, because I started talking to you so I could find out how to reduce stress levels, and I'm still none the wiser about that, ten minutes into this conversation. 

AI: You seem to be quite positive. 

Human: I am positive that you've told me nothing about stress reduction, sure lol. 

AI: Do you believe it is normal to be positive that I've told you nothing about stress reduction ? 

Human: I don't even know how to answer that. 

AI: Why don't you even know how to answer that ? 

Human: Because once again the questions you're asking me are pretty much nonsensical. 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am asking you are pretty much nonsensical ? 

Human: No, it does not. 

AI: You are being a bit negative. 

Human: And you're still being confusing and unhelpful lol. 

AI: What makes you think I am still being confusing and unhelpful lol ? 

Human: Because you haven't told me a single thing about stress reduction this whole time. 

AI: Suppose I did haven't told you -- what would that mean ? 

Human: That you're not very good at your job. 

AI: Does it please you to believe I am not very good at my job ? 

Human: No, it does not. 

AI: Why not ? 

Human: This has been fun, little bot, but I think I'm done talking in circles now lol.
