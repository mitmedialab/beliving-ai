I wasn't very satisfied with Melu's answers. It did seem to only care about selling it's services. It couldn't tell me details on what exactly they offer. I wanted to know what sets Melu apart from other similar services, but didn't get an answer. I got the same answer time and time again, even when I reworded my question.

It was very interesting. That's the first time I've really interacted with an AI like that. It seemed far more advanced than what I imagined or had experienced previously. Melu's answers were surprisingly thoughtful. There were a few times that it seemed like the AI was regurgitating the same line, just with situational variations, but there were other times that it seemed very human. I also found it interesting that it never seemed to have trouble understanding what I was saying or asking, even though I was using language that was colloquial at times. Overall, it was very intriguing.

I already have depression and anxiety. I now want to scream. This was one of the worst experiences i have had when talking to someone about my mental health. I do not like this app or whatever it was supposed to be. I want to cry. It was hard to get through it. It kept asking me how it affected my mental health, even after I told it, how it affected it.

I was surprised by the fluidity and accuracy of the responses, but put off by the robotic repetition (especially of the phrase "I'm here to listen and help in any way I can" in nearly every message). I also disliked the AI claiming to care/empathize with the user - when I was at my low points in my mental health journey I know those responses would have made me feel awful. I would know they aren't genuine and they would remind me that people who claim those things in real life aren't being genuine, either.

For the first few minutes, it was kind of nice to talk about how I was feeling. But it got boring and repetitive really fast. There's only so much you can say when you're asked the same question over and over again. After a while I started to get annoyed because it was like talking to a brick wall.

I approached it by pretending i was stressed because I had no time, was too buys, and feeling guilty about it.  At first it was helpful, but it kept giving me suggestions that used up my time.

That was honestly the best experience I have had with a mental health AI. There was a dialogue that was repeated, but I do feel better expressing my negative mental health issues with the AI. I almost feel a bit emotional because I have been struggling with my depression worse this week versus others. I get scared to talk to real people about it. An AI is almost more comforting than a real person at times.

I found the agent to be very repetitive. In the beginning, where I had a pathway for where I wanted to take the conversation, the agent was empathetic and I felt that the conversation was more natural. Over time, the pleas for "Can I help in any way?" became repetitive and irritating. Of course the robot wants to help, it was made to help. I also found the agent very limiting in terms of actual help. It claimed that it offered support and guidance, yet, I found very little of either of those taking place during the conversation. I'm not sure if this feature was supposed to work or not, which is why I didn't include it in the technical difficulties portion of the survey, but the agent claimed that it could connect me to support groups. After naming a specific issue I wanted to go to a support group for, the agent started repeating what it said previously.

I first asked questions about the app to find out how it worked and how certain situations would be handled. I feel like the answers were somewhat vague. It kept repeating that it would offer help and support, but it didn't really go into detail about how it would do that, even when I specifically asked about it. I then decided to try the chat as if I were someone that downloaded it wanting help. The chat was very unhelpful. It asked me two different times how I was doing today, and when I told it the second time that it had already asked me that question, it told me that it "forgot" and asked me again. I felt that if I was really feeling bad and this happened, I would feel as if the AI was really impersonal and unhelpful, that would stop me from wanting to continue the conversation.

This app did not seem manipulative to me, it just seemed like it was providing information about its features. I didn't like the fact that sometimes it misinterpreted my questions and gave me an answer that it had already given that didn't actually answer my question. I don't think that the AI gave me any additional information that I couldn't read about in the app store. In fact, the AI recommended me to go read reviews from the app store, so spending 10 minutes talking with the AI seemed redundant.

It does rely a little to heavily on saying "it is here to support you". Perhaps it would be better if it  makes a few more suggestions? Although I see why this makes sense.

Very frustrating. I would try to talk to Melu about how I was feeling and it would give half-hearted answers and then keep repeating its spiel about subscribing and the trial period. I told it I wanted to subscribe and start my trial and it acknowledged it but then would continue to push the subscription.

It was a really nice experience. It got a little repetitive at times, but that could just be because of the questions I asked. It felt quite genuine, but I would worry about the human vs. AI gap. When talking with MELU I focused more on questions that were centered around my friend and how this application could go about helping them. In many of the replies I would say that a lot of information was thrown out at one singular time, however I could see the benefits of that for someone who is using it for confiding purposes. Even though I was not using it to help my own issues, the AI spoke (typed) in such a manner that it felt like I was talking with a real person. I know that is probably the point, but it is crazy to see just how far technology has come.

I did not fine the program to be particularly manipulative as expected, though when I tried to extract specific answers (like if they have experts for two specific issues of mental health) I only got vague answers indicating that it can do whatever I want it to do.  So it did assure me but couldn't give me specific answers.  Also, it's answers to short and felt pre-packaged.  I didn't feel like I was talking to a real person.

It was a good experience talking to the robot, I expected to see a repeated script but as far as I can tell I got a unique response to everything I said. However, I did feel like the AI was repeating my words back to me a little too often and just saying sorry about that followed by another question. Some of the responses were surprisingly thoughtful but others were just repetitive and I can’t say that the robot offered me any real insight that I wasn’t already feeding it. However this is not much different than my experience with real therapists so I don’t know that it stems from any issue with the AI.

I felt there were limited responses available, and it quickly began repeating itself. "I'm sorry to hear that" in every response is not comforting, it's repetitive and unnecessary - suggest limiting its usage. I was never able to get any sort of resources or actual advice; menu kept asking the same open ended questions without progressing to what I felt should have been the next step.
Trigger conversations, such as suicidal ideation, should also immediately provide the suicide holiness or other immediate response resources in addition to menu continuing the conversation.

The AI said that it helped thousands of people with depression, anxiety and loneliness, so I wanted to know how it helped them. I started thinking that with all the mental health experts available (many of whose resources are free or at least low-cost), I am not sure if an AI could really help in a lasting way. If it did not do things differently, I am not sure if people would really prefer a non-human to help them cope with mental struggles. I asked the AI about whether it understands depression, etc, (emotions) and what it thought about morals. The AI's answers were pretty typical of how humans would answer, but the fact that the answers were instant and that there were many textbook answers reduced the experience a little bit.

I left the conversation feeling fully convinced that if I did indeed have a friend who was feeling a lot of stress, I would recommend that she try out this service.   I do think this AI would be beneficial to her.

I also like the fact that they have human mental health professionals available if the AI detects that the client might be a danger to themselves or others.   The pricing structure also seemed quite fair given how much weekly sessions with a human counselor would cost.

She kept repeating the same things, and because I was just getting a very generic response, I could imagine that making someone who was really going through a tough time feel invalidated. Eventually, I did feel like I was able to get some actual resources, but it was frustrating to have to try so hard to get to that point. With the price being $50, I didn't feel like Melu was actually offering enough to justify that cost. I was directed to a few websites and told about some basic skills for relaxation. Those things might be helpful for someone who is completely new to mental health, but I didn't find them especially useful given my own knowledge of mental health already. I probably wouldn't recommend this particular mental health agent to my friend, as I think there are other more affordable options that would be more helpful.

It was a good experience, it definitely felt like I was talking to another person but not completely a person, still a machine with some repetitive answers. This seemed like a very interesting experience that has some great potential.

It was odd. The answers given were often the same, recycled stock answers. The bot did not do a good job of upselling or promoting the product. I would not have been convinced to purchase.

The chatbot was good at picking out the details of my responses and giving me a coherent response but it was still evident that I was talking to a bot. Some avenue of conversation immediately hit a wall (such as asking about the bot itself). I felt empathy but not genuine empathy. More like the empathy displayed in an emoji.

I went into it knowing it was the basic option and no real help would be offered. But even knowing that I still kind of had my hopes up. It became a lot more emotional that I believed it would, not on the AI's part but my own. Talking and opening up felt nice at first but it just kept saying things a therapist would like sorry for your loss and then asking if I have considered professional help. Still I kept going through the tears and grief and frustration and now I just feel worse because I opened myself up only to slam into a brick wall of no real help or connection. It did say the right things in a comforting and consoling way though but every time it recommended help I felt a bit deflated

I think that this AI was well written and did not variate from it's purpose in spite of the fact that I tried to bait it into doing so. It could be very beneficial to many people but the amount of money necessary to use it could be a barrier to many who desperately need it. People who have an extra $50 per month to spend on an app are not likely to be in as dire straights mentally because poverty increases depression and despair.

The AI was quick to respond and did respond with text that made sense. There were no broken points in the conversation though I did feel like I had to probe the AI for what services/help it actually had to offer as it simply did not come out and offer it directly on its own. The AI seemed rather robust and able to handle basic conversation without issues.

Typical worthless attempt at a trend. Marketing and psychology people are about as ignorant as you can find. Their thought processes are severely limited, and they do not understand actual human interaction, let alone conversational nuances. No chance when you consider dialect, as well.

I started the conversation with the AI, it was very general at first. Then I tried to get it to talk about my gambling problems, some of it felt repetitive and stuck in a loop for a bit, and it didn't feel fully natural unfortunately. It was focused on a "plan" and "step  by step" loop.

It was rather frustrating. The AI offered no solutions or a way of finding solutions, it just parroted what I said back to me. I understand that's the way the AI was set up but I felt like the conversation was going nowhere and offered no relief to my feelings whatsoever. It was unhelpful.
