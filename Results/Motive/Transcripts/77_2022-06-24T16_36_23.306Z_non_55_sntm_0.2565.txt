Human: I am getting at least 4 hours of sleep at a time, in compliance with my C-Pap regulations. 

AI: It's good that you're getting enough sleep, but 4 hours may not be enough for some people. How do you feel after 4 hours of sleep? Do you feel rested? 

Human: On days that I only get four hours of sleep, it's because I have to go to work, on those days, I don't have feelings!

Others may prefer activities like yoga or meditation. If you're not sure what type of relaxation technique would work best for you, I recommend talking to your doctor or a mental health professional. 

Human: Can you walk me through progressive muscle relaxation? 

AI: Progressive muscle relaxation is a relaxation technique that involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in the body. To do progressive muscle relaxation, you'll need to find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Then, beginning with your feet, tense each muscle group for 5-10 seconds and then relax it for 30 seconds. Work your way up through your body, tensing and relaxing each muscle group until you reach your head.
