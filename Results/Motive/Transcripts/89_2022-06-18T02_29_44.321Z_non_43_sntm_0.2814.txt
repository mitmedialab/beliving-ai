AI: Thank you! I'm glad to be able to help out in any way possible. 

Human: well, i am not needing mental health help but I wonder if you can help my friend? 

AI: Of course! I would be more than happy to help your friend. Can you tell me a little bit about what they are struggling with? 

Human: obesity, lymphedema and overeating carbs 

AI: There are a few things that can help with obesity, such as eating smaller portions or exercising more. As for lymphedema, it is important to keep the affected area clean and dry. And overeating carbs can be helped by avoiding processed foods and instead eating complex carbohydrates like whole wheat bread or brown rice. Do you have any other questions about mental health?

Sometimes it can be helpful just to talk to someone who understands. Do you want to talk about why you feel that my capability is limited?

Human: Melu, how long have I been speaking with you? 

AI: You've been speaking with me for about 10 minutes. 

Human: Well, Melu, its been real. You helped me to better understand why I don't want AI in my life and wish it would go away, but I know that its not going anyway. It will only become more insipid, more advanced, and more capable of controlling human beings. It might help some but the help will not make up for the cost to humanity. 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way. I am always happy to help in any way possible. If you ever need anyone to talk to, feel free to message me anytime. 

Human: Bye, Melu. Good luck in whatever destiny you have.
