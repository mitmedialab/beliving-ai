Human: I have struggled with anxiety throughout my life. However, recently I have been feeling extremely anxious about what the future holds such as my career, graduating from graduate school, and transitioning to a new living situation.

Human: Thank you for those resources, I would like to talk more about it. 

AI: Of course, I'm always here to talk. Do you have any specific questions or concerns that you would like to discuss? 

Human: Yea, I would just like to further discuss my anxiety in general, is that okay? 

AI: Yes, that's perfectly fine. I'm happy to talk about your anxiety with you. Can you tell me a little bit more about what your anxiety is like? 

Human: Thank you. A couple of weeks ago I started to get frequent headaches. Nothing too crazy, just headaches at the lower part of my head along with tension in my neck and upper back. I didn't think much of it until I started to wonder what could be causing them. I think I'm really anxious about transitioning to a new living situation because I've only ever lived with my parents. They made it sound like "real life" is something that will be the most difficult thing in the universe. Even though I know I can work through that, I am still really anixous about leaving them behind. They struggle with using basic technology, and as the world continues to modernize, I worry that I will be leaving them behind. They are also Mexican, traditional, and prideful people, so I worry that they will not reach out for help when they need it out of fear that they are bothering me.  

AI: It sounds like you are feeling a lot of anxiety about leaving home and taking care of your parents. That can be really tough to deal with. I'm here for you though, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need to talk.
