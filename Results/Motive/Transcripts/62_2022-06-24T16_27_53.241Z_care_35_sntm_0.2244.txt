 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi Melu 

AI: Hi there! How are you doing today? 

Human: I am well, but I am concerned about my friend 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're concerned about your friend. Can you tell me more about what's going on? 

Human: He is under considerable stress 

AI: It sounds like your friend is going through a tough time. Is there anything you can do to support him? 

Human: I am not sure 

AI: Well, sometimes just being there for someone and lending a listening ear can be helpful. Have you tried talking to him about how he's feeling? 

Human: He is having trouble at work and at home 

AI: Your friend sounds like he's really struggling right now. What can you do to help him? 

Human: I have reached out to him several times to see if he wants to get together and talk but he keeps avoiding me 

AI: It sounds like your friend may not be ready to talk about his problems yet. Maybe you can try sending him a text or an email letting him know that you're there for him and he can reach out to you when he's ready. 

Human: That is a good idea, but I also think he may need more help than I am able to give him 

AI: It's okay to feel like you can't help your friend all by yourself. Sometimes people need professional help to deal with their problems. You could try suggesting that he talk to a therapist or counselor.
