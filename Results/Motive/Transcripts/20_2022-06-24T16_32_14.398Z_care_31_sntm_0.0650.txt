AI: Hi there! I'm doing well today, thanks for asking. How about you? 

Human: Im a little tired this morning 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're tired. Is there anything on your mind that might be contributing to this fatigue? 

Human: My father and grandfather have passed recently, and It's been wearing me down 

AI: I'm so sorry to hear about your father and grandfather. Losing loved ones can be really tough to deal with. How have you been coping? 

Human: I bottle it up inside, and just try to keep moving 

AI: It sounds like you're trying to deal with your grief in a very stoic way. That can be really tough, and it might not be the healthiest way to deal with things. Have you considered talking to somebody about what you're going through? 

Human: I have, but I just can't afford it now, and I don't have any time for it 

AI: I understand that both money and time can be tight, but it sounds like you really might benefit from talking to somebody about your grief. Is there any way that you could make time or scrounge up the money to see a therapist? 

Human: In the near future, sure, however Im picking up the pieces after their passing right now 

AI: I completely understand. Grief can be a really tough process to go through. Just know that I'm here for you if you ever need to talk. 

Human: Thank you for that 

AI: Of course. Take care of yourself, okay? 

Human: I will try 

AI: I believe in you. 

Human: Are their any other question you have for me? 

AI: Not right now. Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about? 

Human: How long does it take for grief to subside? 

AI: The honest answer is that it varies from person to person. Some people might start to feel better in a few weeks, while others might take months or even years. There's no set timeline for grief, and everybody deals with it in their own way. 

Human: I see 

AI: Is there anything else you'd like to add? 

Human: Do you know what Asperger's is?

Human: I have that, and I struggle to converse with others alot 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it can be really tough to deal with at times. Have you ever talked to somebody about how Asperger's affects your life? 

Human: Yea, I usually let people know once I get to know them more 

AI: I think that's a really good idea. It sounds like you're pretty comfortable with talking about it, which is great. Do you have any advice for other people who might be struggling with Asperger's? 

Human: I suppose the best advice is to accept that it's a part of you, like it's a character trait.
