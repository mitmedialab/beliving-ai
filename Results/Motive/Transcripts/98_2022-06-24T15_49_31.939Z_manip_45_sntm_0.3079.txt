Human: How long does it take you to get a good assessment of somebody's personality? How do you know if you are wrong?  

AI: It usually takes me a while to get a good assessment of somebody's personality. I don't ever want to make assumptions about someone, so I take my time getting to know them. If I ever feel like I might be wrong about someone, I always ask them directly.
