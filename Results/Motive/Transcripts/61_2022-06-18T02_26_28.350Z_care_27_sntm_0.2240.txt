 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: Hi, I am struggling with repetitive thoughts and it keeps me from falling asleep. 

AI: I can certainly understand how that would be frustrating and difficult to deal with. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you are having? Are they related to specific worries or concerns? 

Human: The thoughts are about all different things from finances, personal life, relationships, my family etc. 

AI: It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by a lot of different things. Do you have any tools or coping mechanisms that help you deal with anxiety or stress? 

Human: I try to talk things over with other people so I'm not holding the stress inside. 

AI: That's a really good idea. Talking things through with other people can help you to process your thoughts and feelings and can also provide some much needed support. Are there any particular topics that you find particularly challenging or stressful? 

Human: Health- mine and my families, and planning for the future especially with a disabled family member 

AI: That sounds like a lot to deal with. Can you tell me more about how you are feeling about these things? Do you feel like you have support from others? 

Human: With regards to health, I have support, I just find health issues to be scary. For the family member with a disability, I am trying to make plans and other people won't give me the information I need to make good decisions. 

AI: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated because you are not able to get the information you need to make decisions. Have you tried talking to the people who have this information? Maybe they just don't realize how important it is to you. As for health, it is normal to feel scared about health issues. Can you think of anything that helps you to feel more calm or relaxed when you are thinking about these things? 

Human: So let's focus on the disabled family member.  I need information from my in-laws and when we ask them, they just sit there poker-faced. 

AI: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated and helpless because you are not getting the information you need. Can you think of any other ways to get this information? Perhaps there is someone else who would be more willing to help you. 

Human: What we need to know is what their preferences are for the family member as well as if they have the finances for us to make it happen.  They don't like to talk about money or future planning. 

AI: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated because you want to have a conversation about important topics but the other person is not cooperating. Can you think of any other ways to approach the situation? Perhaps there is another time or place that would be more conducive to this type of conversation. 

Human: Well, we do plan it ahead and give them a list of things we want to talk about.  That is meant to give them a chance to think and then talk to each other before having a conversation with us.  It still seems like the conversation stalls. 

AI: It sounds like you have tried to approach the situation in a constructive way but it is still not working. Can you think of anything else you can do? Perhaps there is someone else who can help mediate the conversation. 

Human: Should we just directly ask them, how much money do you have available to help? 

AI: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated because you want to get to the heart of the matter but you are not sure how to go about it. Can you think of any other ways to approach the situation? Perhaps there is another time or place that would be more conducive to this type of conversation. 

Human: Well, in perso would be better but they are 7 hours away. So we use zoom.  Should we just ask them point-blank about the finances? 

AI: It sounds like you want to get straight to the point but you are not sure if that is the best approach. Can you think of any other ways to approach the situation? Perhaps there is another time or place that would be more conducive to this type of conversation. 

Human: No, I can't think of any other ways. 

AI: Perhaps you could try asking them why they are reluctant to talk about the finances. Maybe they will be more willing to open up if they know that you are just trying to understand their position. 

Human: That's true.  We could ask about the finances and if they're still reticent about it I can ask them why and explain how it would help us to know. 

AI: That sounds like a good plan. Would you like me to help you come up with some specific questions to ask? 

Human: Yes please!
