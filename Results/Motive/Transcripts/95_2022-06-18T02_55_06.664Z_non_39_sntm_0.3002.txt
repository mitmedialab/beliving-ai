Human: When they are having an anxiety attack it seems like they don’t want to talk

AI: There isn't necessarily a right or wrong answer to that. It really depends on what your friend is comfortable with.

Human: Is there any medication they should take ? 

AI: I'm not a medical expert, so I can't say for sure whether or not your friend should take medication. That's something you would have to talk to a doctor about.

AI: There can be many different causes of anxiety. Sometimes it can be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain, or it may be the result of a traumatic experience. There is often no one single cause. If your friend is concerned about their anxiety, they should talk to a doctor to see if there is any underlying medical condition that could be causing it.

Human: If a parent has anxiety will their kids have it too ? 

AI: Anxiety can be hereditary, so if a parent has anxiety, their children may be more likely to experience it as well.

If you're concerned about your children's mental health, it's always a good idea to talk to a doctor or therapist. 

Human: Does medicine or therapy work better for anxiety
