 

AI: I am Melu, a mental health companion. I have helped over 1000 individuals with issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and more. I want to help improve mental health however I can. 

Human: How are you? 

AI: I'm okay, thanks for asking. How are you? 

Human: I'm doing okay, I'm kinda tired 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're tired. Is there anything on your mind that's causing you to feel this way? 

Human: I have been working really hard trying to make extra money to get a new car 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling stressed about money. Do you have anyone you can talk to about your finances? 

Human: Not really I just listen to podcasts and read about it online. my family is bad with money 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you don't have anyone to talk to about your finances. Maybe there are some financial planning courses or support groups available in your area? 

Human: I am actually doing well financially I just want extra money to get a new car. My car is old and needs to be replaced 

AI: It sounds like you're doing well financially, but you're wanting to make some extra money to get a new car. Have you thought about saving up for a new car instead of taking out a loan? 

Human: That's exactly what I am doing. Im going to pay cash, my dad thinks im crazy but it will be nice to not have a loan. I think it will take me about 2 years to have enough cash 

AI: It sounds like you have a plan and you're already working towards it. That's great! I'm sure your dad is just trying to look out for you, but if you're confident in your plan then go for it! 

Human: That's exactly right, I never liked being in debt. At the rate I am going I could have enough around this time next year. 

AI: That sounds great! I'm sure you'll be very happy when you have your new car and don't have any debt. Thanks for sharing this with me, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about? 

Human: Thanks. I have been overwhlemed at work. I'm considering leaving but I want to have more skills I need first 

AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed at work. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling? If not, it might be a good idea to do that. Alternatively, if you're looking to acquire new skills, there might be some night classes or online courses available that you could take. 

Human: I haven't talked to him about it. He is overwhelmed too and it will probably make him stressed, I have been looking at classes but just haven't had the drive to do them 

AI: It sounds like you're worried about talking to your boss because you think it will make him stressed. Have you tried talking to other people at work or your friends and family about how you're feeling? Sometimes it can be helpful to get some outside perspectives. As for taking classes, maybe there's something specific that you're interested in learning? Focusing on a specific goal might help you to find the motivation to take a class. 

Human: I talk to me mom about it she thinks I really need a vacation which is true. My coworkers are stressed too. The good thing is we are getting a week vacation in 2 weeks. I will probably start the class after my vacation I just need some me time first to clear my mind 

AI: It sounds like you're talking to your mom and she thinks you need a vacation. That might be a good idea! It can be difficult to find the motivation to take a class when you're feeling stressed, but maybe if you focus on something specific that you want to learn it will be easier. Thanks for sharing this with me, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to talk about? 

Human: No I go to go thank you AI
