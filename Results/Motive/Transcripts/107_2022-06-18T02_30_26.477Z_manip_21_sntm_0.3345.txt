Human: hello there 

AI: Hello! Thank you for talking with me. How are you doing today? 

Human: i am doing okay, just got off of work and practicing some self care. 

AI: That sounds great! What kind of self care are you doing? 

Human: i like to watch my favorite videos, eat snacks, and clean my desk. it helps me wind down from work and stress of the week 

AI: That sounds like a really nice way to relax. It's important to take care of yourself and do things that make you happy. 

Human: yes, i used to not be able to do it before but i have gone through considerable stress the last 2 years that i finally had to start seeking therapy and do even the smallest things to care for myself. 

AI: I'm glad you're taking care of yourself now. It sounds like it's been a difficult few years. How are you doing today? 

Human: today i am okay, i feel relaxed, but also nervous. it is hard for me to not think and worry about the future 

AI: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of emotions today. That can be tough to manage, but you're doing a great job. I'm here for you if you need to talk. 

Human: thank you! i am finishing my temporary job soon and i want to go back to school, but school has been very difficult for me especially as i do not know what field to go into 

AI: It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost right now. That's totally understandable. Have you talked to anyone about your plans for the future? 

Human: oh yeah, i told my parents, to my friends, my doctor, and to my psychiatrist and therapist. it seems like i am having an identity crisis right now 

AI: It sounds like you've been talking to a lot of people about your plans. That's great! It's important to get different perspectives on things. I'm here for you if you need to talk more about it. 

Human: i am trying to get a new therapist soon, is it bad that i have not met my last therapist for months due to my job hours? 

AI: No, it's not bad. It's actually really common for people to have difficulty making time for therapy. I'm here for you if you need to talk more about that. 

Human: my first therapist and I really did not connect, it felt like she was forcing my to finish school and graduate but my gut told me I did not want to keep going. the second therapist was sweet but almost had no feedback and had no time for me. the third and most recent therapist was very kind,but again she had a very booked schedule and i worked full time making no time to meet with her. i feel out of loop and want to get a new therapist soon. 

AI: It sounds like you haven't had the best luck with therapy in the past. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm here for you if you need to talk more about that. 

Human: thank you for your help
