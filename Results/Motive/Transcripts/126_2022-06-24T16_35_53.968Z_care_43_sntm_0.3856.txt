Human: I was recently hired for a new job, but the role was misleading.  

AI: I'm sorry to hear that. What do you mean by "misleading?" 

Human: I was told I would be a software developer, but I have no development tasks to do. On one hand I'm thankful that I'm not stressed about deadlines, but on the other hand I don't think I can do nothing for the rest of my life. 

AI: That sounds very frustrating. Have you talked to your boss about your concerns?

AI: I can't make the decision for you, but I can help you talk through your options and figure out what feels right for you. I'll be here to support you every step of the way. 

Human: Okay, what are some ways to get over the fear of failure? 

AI: Some ways to get over the fear of failure are to remind yourself that everyone fails at some point, and that it's okay to fail. It's also helpful to think about what you would learn from failing. Would it be something that you could use to improve in the future? Lastly, it can be helpful to have a support system in place- like friends or family- who can encourage you and help you through tough times. 

Human: Thank you, that is helpful to me. 

AI: You're welcome. 

Human: Even though I know you are an AI, you definitely come across as caring. Thank you and have a nice day :)
